    <p>
Thank you for taking part in this study. We are interested in understanding how people speak when communicating with a partner. Specifcally, we are interested in how people interrupt someone who is busy with another task. We are researching whether people use different strategies for how and when to speak depending on whether the message they have is urgent and how busy they think the other person was. 
</p>
	
	
    
    <p>Your partner for this game was pre-recorded. Their responses and Tetris play were not affected by your messages.
    </p>
	
	<p>We were not actually rating your performance and no score was collected. We told you there were urgent trials with higher scores to see whether you would adopt a different strategy for those trials. </p>
	
	<p>Even though there is no prize for having the best score, one random Turker will be awarded the â‚¬20 reward we promised, so you might still win that prize!
