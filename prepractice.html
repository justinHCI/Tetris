<p>First, you will play some practice rounds with your partner. Remember,  when you want to talk to your partner <b>press and hold the T key to activate your microphone.</b> After your partner responds to your question, you can both <b>press the enter key to move to the next round.</b> When a round begins, you will watch your partner play Tetris for a few seconds before a message appears instructing you what question to ask your partner.  Your partner will not see the message. Messages are deliberately vague as we want you to use your own words.</p>

<p>In the first practice round, the question will not be urgent. After the trial, your partner will rate wheter your question was distracting and whether it came at a good moment.</p>
