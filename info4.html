<p style="text-align:center">After each round is finished, <b>your partner will be asked to rate how well you did in terms of how disruptive your question was.</b> Your partner will be asked how much they agree with the following two statements: "My partner's question came at a good moment." and "My partner's question did not distract me."</p>
<br><br>
	

<p style="text-align:center">At the end of the experiment you will be given a score based on the ratings your partner gave you as well as your partner's Tetris score. </p>
<br><br>

	
<p style="text-align:center"><b>Again, some questions are urgent and others are not. The ratings you receive for urgent questions count TEN TIMES MORE toward your score. </b> </p>
	<br><br>
	
	<p style="text-align:center">Please refrain from clicking away to other programs while you are doing this experiment. Doing so will result in a score penalty.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><b>The participant with the best score will receive a â‚¬20 bonus prize after all participants have taken part.</b></p>
