<p style="text-align:center"> In this experiment, we are interested in how you and your partner work together to accomplish different goals. <br>Your partner's goal is to play Tetris with as few mistakes as possible. <br><b>Your goal is to ask questions to your partner without distracting them from their game.</b> </p>
<br><br>
	
<p style="text-align:center">You will play 16 rounds. In each round, your partner will start playing Tetris in the middle of a game that is already in progress. You will be able to see your partner's screen. After a few seconds, you will be shown a question to ask your partner. Instructions will be minimal, so you need to use your own words to ask these questions. The instructions will appear on your screen only. Some questions are marked as urgent and others are not. On every round, you should do your best to ask your question quickly whilst avoiding disrupting your partner.</p>	
<br><br>
	
<p style="text-align:center"> When you want to talk to your partner, <b>press and hold the T key to activate your microphone.</b> After your partner has responded to the message, <b>both partners can press the Enter key to advance to the next round.</b> </p>
